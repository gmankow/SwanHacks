Part A: Multi-Digit Addition

58,492 + 37,806 = 96,298

406,218 + 195,437 = 601,655

Part B: Multi-Digit Subtraction

92,504 − 67,289 = 25,215

703,810 − 248,975 = 454,835

Part C: Multiplication

324 × 27 = 8,748
(324 × 20 = 6,480; 324 × 7 = 2,268; total = 8,748)

1,406 × 8 = 11,248

Part D: Division

864 ÷ 6 = 144

3,528 ÷ 12 = 294

7,425 ÷ 25 = 297
(25 × 300 = 7,500; subtract 75 → 25 × 3 = 75)

Part E: Order of Operations

6 × (12 − 7) = 6 × 5 = 30

48 ÷ 6 + 9 = 8 + 9 = 17

(30 + 18) ÷ 6 = 48 ÷ 6 = 8

Part F: Mixed Computation

14,295 − 8,672 = 5,623

508 × 40 = 20,320

18,400 ÷ 50 = 368

Part G: Multi-Step Word Problems

12,480 − 4,965 − 3,807 = 3,708
(After both shipments, 3,708 boxes remain.)

4,752 ÷ 6 = 792 packs

2,385 ÷ 615 = 3 full days with 540 miles remaining
(615 × 3 = 1,845; 2,385 − 1,845 = 540)

Part H: Challenge Problems

Multiply by 100, then divide by 10 → effectively multiply by 10.
Moves digits one place to the left.
Example: 47 becomes 470.

The student’s reasoning works because dividing both numbers by 10 gives:
4,000 ÷ 80 = (400 ÷ 8) = 50.
You’re not “dropping zeros” randomly — you’re dividing the numerator and denominator by the same power of ten.
