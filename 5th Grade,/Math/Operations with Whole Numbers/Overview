Objectives

Students will understand and apply:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with whole numbers

Strategies for solving multi-digit operations efficiently and accurately

Models and representations (arrays, area models, number lines, place-value strategies)

The relationship between multiplication and division

Order of operations for evaluating expressions

Key Content
1. Addition and Subtraction Structure

Introduce and review how place value supports multi-digit addition and subtraction.

Emphasize that digits must be aligned by place (ones under ones, tens under tens) to add or subtract correctly.

Model how regrouping works:

Carrying occurs when a place exceeds 9 in addition

Borrowing occurs when the top digit is smaller in subtraction

Demonstrate solving multi-digit equations step-by-step, using both standard algorithms and place-value strategies.

2. Multiplication Concepts and Models

Teach multiple ways to understand and represent multiplication:

Equal groups

Arrays

Area models

Repeated addition

Show how multi-digit multiplication builds from place value, with each shift representing ×10.

Introduce standard algorithms after conceptual models so students understand why the steps work.

Connect multiplication facts to patterns and strategies for fluency.

3. Division Concepts and Relationships

Explain division as:

Making equal groups

Repeated subtraction

The inverse of multiplication

Use models such as arrays, equal groups, and number lines to build understanding.

Demonstrate partial quotients and long division for larger numbers.

Highlight fact families to show the relationship between multiplication and division.

Practice interpreting remainders in real-world contexts.

4. Order of Operations

Review how to evaluate expressions using a consistent order:

Parentheses

Multiplication and Division from left to right

Addition and Subtraction from left to right

Use examples to model simplification step-by-step.

Explain that following this order ensures everyone gets the same result for the same expression.

Apply order of operations to whole-number expressions without exponents.

5. Problem-Solving with All Four Operations

Teach students how to decide which operation a problem requires.

Model using equations, bar models, or diagrams to represent the situation.

Practice multi-step word problems that require combining operations.

Emphasize explaining reasoning and checking answers using inverse operations.

Reinforce that accurate problem-solving includes choosing the correct operation, showing work, and justifying the solution.
