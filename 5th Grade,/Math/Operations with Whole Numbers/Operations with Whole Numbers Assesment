Explain your thinking clearly.

A number is multiplied by 100 and then divided by 10.
How does the final result compare to the original number? Explain using place value.

A student says that 4,000 ÷ 80 equals 50 because “you just drop the zeros.”
Explain whether this reasoning is correct and why the answer works.
