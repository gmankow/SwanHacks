Key Content
1. Place Value Structure:

Introduce and review a place value chart from billions to thousandths.

Emphasize that each place is 10 times greater than the place to its right and 1/10 of the place to its left.

Model naming and identifying the value of digits within a multi-digit number and within decimals.

2. Reading and Writing Numbers:

Teach the three standard forms:

Standard form (using digits)

Word form (written out in words)

Expanded form (sum of each digit’s value)

3. Comparing and Ordering Numbers:

Explain how to compare multi-digit numbers by examining digits from left to right.

Demonstrate comparing decimals by starting at the decimal point and examining digits to the right.

Practice ordering mixed sets of numbers, including decimals.

4. Rounding:

Review rounding rules: identify the rounding place, look to the digit on the right, and decide whether to round up or keep the digit the same.

Apply rounding to whole numbers and decimals.

5. Powers of Ten:

Explain that multiplying or dividing by 10, 100, and 1,000 shifts digits left or right.

Show examples with whole numbers and decimals.

Reinforce that each step corresponds to one place-value shift.
