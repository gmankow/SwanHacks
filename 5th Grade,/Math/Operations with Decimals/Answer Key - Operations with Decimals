Part A: Decimal Addition

6.42 + 3.758 = 10.178

19.806 + 7.94 = 27.746

Part B: Decimal Subtraction

15.72 − 8.946 = 6.774

42.5 − 19.867 = 22.633

Part C: Multiplying Decimals

3.8 × 2.4 = 9.12
(38×24=912 → 2 decimal places)

0.56 × 9 = 5.04

Part D: Dividing Decimals

9.12 ÷ 4 = 2.28

35.7 ÷ 0.3 = 119
(×10 both numbers → 357 ÷ 3 = 119)

6.048 ÷ 12 = 0.504

Part E: Order of Operations

(4.5 + 2.36) × 3 = 6.86 × 3 = 20.58

12.8 ÷ (4 + 1.2) = 12.8 ÷ 5.2 = 2.4615… ≈ 2.46

6.4 + 0.8 × 5 = 6.4 + 4 = 10.4

Part F: Estimation & Reasonableness

5.72 + 3.98 ≈ 6 + 4 = 10

7.86 × 9.2 ≈ 8 × 9 = 72

4.8 ÷ 0.2 → result is larger
Dividing by a number less than 1 increases the value.

Part G: Mixed Operations

3.75 + 18.6 − 0.95 = 21.4

0.48 × 0.25 = 0.12

7.5 ÷ 0.05 = 150
(×100 both → 750 ÷ 5 = 150)

Part H: Multi-Step Word Problems

Leaks: 0.37 × 6 = 2.22 gallons
Remaining: 18.45 − 2.22 = 16.23 gallons

126 ÷ 0.84 = 150 boxes

3.75 × 12 = 45 miles
Goal: 45 + 4.2 = 49.2 miles

Bought: 6 × 1.25 = 7.5 pounds
Needs: 9.6 − 7.5 = 2.1 pounds more

Part I: Challenge Questions

Multiplying by 0.1 moves every digit one place to the right because each place becomes 1/10 of its value.
Example: 4.5 → 0.45 (each digit shifts into a place worth 1/10 as much).

Dividing by 0.01 makes the number 100 times larger because 0.01 is one hundredth.
4.5 ÷ 0.01 = 450
(×100 because dividing by a hundredth tells how many hundredths fit inside the number.)
