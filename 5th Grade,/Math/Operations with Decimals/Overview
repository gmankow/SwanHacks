Objectives

Students will understand and apply:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with decimals

Alignment of place values when operating with decimals

Models and visual representations (grids, number lines, area models) to make sense of decimal operations

Strategies for estimating and checking the reasonableness of answers

How place-value shifts relate to multiplying or dividing decimals by powers of ten

Key Content
1. Understanding Decimal Structure

Introduce and review decimal place value from tenths through thousandths.

Emphasize that the decimal point separates whole numbers from fractional parts.

Connect each place to powers of ten:

each place to the right is 1/10 the value

each place to the left is 10 times the value

Model how decimal digits represent parts of a whole using grids, money, and base-ten visuals.

2. Adding and Subtracting Decimals

Teach students to line up decimal points before adding or subtracting.

Review that place values must match (tenths with tenths, hundredths with hundredths).

Model using:

base-ten blocks

place-value charts

money representations

Reinforce checking work using estimation to see if the answer is reasonable.

3. Multiplying Decimals

Explain multiplication using models first:

area models

grids (100-squares)

repeated addition representations

Show how to multiply normally (ignoring the decimal), then place the decimal in the product according to the total number of decimal places.

Connect this to powers of ten: the decimal shifts left when multiplying by tenths, hundredths, etc.

Practice multiplying decimals by whole numbers and by other decimals.

4. Dividing Decimals

Teach division conceptually:

sharing/grids

measurement models

number lines

Explain that when dividing by a decimal, students can multiply both numbers by the same power of ten to make the divisor a whole number.

Model decimal shifts clearly (e.g., multiply both by 10, 100, or 1,000).

Use long division or partial quotients to divide decimals by whole numbers and by decimals.

Practice interpreting remainders or decimal digits in real-world contexts.

5. Rounding and Estimation with Decimals

Review rounding rules for decimals:

find the rounding place

look at the digit to the right

round up or keep the digit the same

Use rounding and compatible numbers to estimate solutions and check reasonableness of decimal operations.

Practice rounding to tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.

6. Powers of Ten and Decimal Shifts

Explain how multiplying or dividing decimals by 10, 100, or 1,000 moves digits left or right.

Model with place-value charts to show how the decimal point appears to “move.”

Give examples:

×10 → digits shift 1 place left

÷100 → digits shift 2 places right

Reinforce that this is a predictable pattern based on place value.
