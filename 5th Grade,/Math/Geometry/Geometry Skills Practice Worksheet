Part A: Lines & Angles

Draw and label each:

A line

A ray

A line segment

Identify each angle as acute, right, obtuse, or straight:
a. 47°
b. 90°
c. 135°
d. 180°

Write whether each pair is parallel, perpendicular, or intersecting:
a. The sides of a square
b. A “T” shape
c. Railroad tracks
d. Two lines that cross but are not 90°

Part B: Classifying 2-D Shapes

Classify each triangle by angles and sides:
a. A triangle with angles 40°, 50°, 90°
b. A triangle with three equal sides
c. A triangle with one angle measuring 120°

Classify each quadrilateral:
a. Opposite sides are parallel; all angles 90°
b. All sides equal; opposite sides parallel
c. One pair of parallel sides only

Part C: Measuring & Drawing Angles

Measure these angles using a protractor (draw them if needed):
a. ∠ABC
b. ∠DEF
(Teacher inserts angle drawings)

Draw a 65° angle and label its vertex P.

Part D: Area & Perimeter

Find the perimeter: length = 12 cm, width = 7 cm.

Find the area of a rectangle with length = 9 ft, width = 4 ft.

A shape is made of two rectangles:

Rectangle A: 6 × 3

Rectangle B: 4 × 3
Find the total area.

Part E: Volume

Find the volume of a rectangular prism:
l = 5 cm, w = 2 cm, h = 4 cm

A box has a base of 6 cm × 3 cm and height 10 cm.
How many cubic centimeters can it hold?
