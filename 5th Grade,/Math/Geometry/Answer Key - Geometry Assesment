Part A: Lines & Angles

Drawings (answers depend on student drawings):

Line: extends forever both ways

Line segment: two endpoints

Ray: one endpoint, extends infinitely in one direction

Angle Types:
a. 32° – Acute
b. 90° – Right
c. 150° – Obtuse
d. 180° – Straight

Parallel: lines that never meet

Perpendicular: lines that meet at 90°

Intersecting: lines that cross, not 90°

(Teacher checks based on student figures.)

Part B: Classifying Shapes

Triangles:
a. 60°, 60°, 60° → Equilateral, Acute
b. 110°, 40°, 30° → Obtuse, Scalene
c. 65°, 65°, 50° → Isosceles, Acute

Quadrilaterals:
a. Four equal sides, no right angles → Rhombus
b. Opposite sides parallel, all angles 90° → Rectangle
c. One pair of parallel sides → Trapezoid

Part C: Area & Perimeter

Area = l × w = 12 × 9 = 108 m²

Perimeter = 8 + 12 + 15 = 35 cm

Composite shape:

Area A = 10 × 4 = 40

Area B = 6 × 4 = 24
Total area = 64 square units

Part D: Volume

Volume = 7 × 5 × 3 = 105 cm³

Volume = base × height
360 = 9 × 4 × h
360 = 36h
h = 10 cm

Part E: Coordinate Plane

Points: A(1,2), B(1,6), C(6,6), D(6,2)

Student plots points (teacher-checked)

Shape formed: Rectangle

Perimeter:

Side lengths: vertical = 4 units, horizontal = 5 units
P = 2(4 + 5) = 18 units

Area:
A = 5 × 4 = 20 square units

Part F: Word Problems

Area of pool = 15 × 8 = 120 m²

Triangle angle sum = 180°
180 − (50 + 65) = 65°

Volume = 10 × 6 × 4 = 240 cm³

Part G: Challenge Problems

All squares are rectangles because they have 4 right angles and opposite sides parallel.

Not all rectangles are squares because rectangles do not require 4 equal sides.

A rhombus — it has 4 equal sides and diagonals that intersect at right angles.
(If diagonals are also equal, it becomes a square.)
