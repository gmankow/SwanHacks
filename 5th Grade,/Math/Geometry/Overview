Objectives

Students will understand and apply:

Classifying two-dimensional figures based on properties (angles, sides, symmetry)

Understanding and identifying types of angles and lines

Measuring angles using a protractor

Calculating area and perimeter of rectangles and composite figures

Understanding concepts of volume for rectangular prisms

Recognizing and drawing geometric shapes on coordinate planes

Key Content
1. Lines, Line Segments, Rays, and Angles

Introduce geometry vocabulary:

Lines extend forever in both directions

Line segments have two endpoints

Rays begin at one point and extend infinitely

Angles are formed by two rays with a shared endpoint (vertex)

Teach angle types:

Acute (< 90°)

Right (90°)

Obtuse (> 90° and < 180°)

Straight (180°)

Model how to identify and classify these using diagrams.

Explain parallel, perpendicular, and intersecting lines with visuals.

2. Classifying 2-D Figures

Teach how to classify shapes by their attributes:

Triangles by angle (acute, right, obtuse) and sides (scalene, isosceles, equilateral)

Quadrilaterals (parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square, trapezoid)

Polygons by number of sides (pentagon, hexagon, octagon)

Emphasize defining attributes, such as:

number of sides

equal sides/equal angles

presence of parallel or perpendicular lines

Use Venn diagrams and charts to show overlapping categories (e.g., all squares are rectangles).

3. Measuring Angles

Teach how to use a protractor:

Align the baseline

Place vertex correctly

Read the correct scale (inner or outer)

Practice measuring and drawing angles to the nearest degree.

Explain that angle size measures rotation, not line length.

4. Area and Perimeter

Review formulas:

Perimeter: distance around a shape

Area of rectangles and squares: A = l × w

Composite area: break shapes into smaller rectangles

Demonstrate real-world connections (fences, flooring, posters, fields).

Emphasize distinguishing when a problem asks for area or perimeter.

5. Volume of Rectangular Prisms

Introduce volume as the amount of space inside a 3-D object.

Teach formula:

V = l × w × h

Use unit cubes to model how volume builds layer by layer.

Connect volume to real-world objects: boxes, aquariums, storage bins.

6. Coordinate Plane Basics

Introduce the coordinate grid:

x-axis (horizontal)

y-axis (vertical)

Origin (0,0)

Teach students to:

plot ordered pairs

identify quadrants

see patterns in points (forms of shapes, horizontal vs vertical movement)

Use simple figures on the grid (rectangles, triangles) to connect geometry and graphing.
