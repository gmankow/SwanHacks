Objectives

Students will understand and apply:

Interpreting fractions as parts of a whole, parts of a set, and points on a number line

Comparing and ordering fractions using models, common denominators, and benchmarks

Equivalent fractions and simplifying fractions

Adding and subtracting fractions with like and unlike denominators

Multiplying fractions by whole numbers and by fractions

Understanding and finding mixed numbers and improper fractions

Solving real-world problems involving fractions

Key Content
1. Understanding Fractions

Introduce fractions as:

Part of a whole

Part of a group or set

A number located on a number line

Teach vocabulary:

Numerator: number of parts being used

Denominator: total number of equal parts

Use models:

Area models

Number lines

Fraction strips

Sets of objects

Emphasize equal parts and fairness when partitioning shapes.

2. Equivalent Fractions & Simplifying

Explain that fractions can represent the same value even if the numbers look different.

Teach methods:

Multiplying or dividing numerator and denominator by the same number

Using fraction models or number lines

Identifying greatest common factor for simplifying

Show that simplified fractions name the same amount using the fewest parts.

3. Comparing & Ordering Fractions

Teach comparison strategies:

Common denominators

Common numerators

Benchmark fractions (0, 1/2, 1)

Cross multiplication (conceptually, not just as a trick)

Visual models

Practice ordering sets of fractions from least to greatest using number lines and reasoning.

4. Mixed Numbers & Improper Fractions

Teach how to convert between:

Mixed numbers → Improper fractions

Improper fractions → Mixed numbers

Model using:

Repeated addition

Equal groups

Visual fraction bars

Emphasize understanding that improper fractions represent more than one whole.

5. Adding & Subtracting Fractions
With like denominators:

Add/subtract numerators

Keep denominator the same

Simplify if needed

With unlike denominators:

Teach methods to find a common denominator:

Least common multiple (LCM)

Using multiples lists

Visual fraction models

Then:

Rewrite equivalent fractions

Add/subtract numerators

Simplify or convert to mixed numbers

6. Multiplying Fractions

Teach two situations:

Multiplying a fraction by a whole number:

Repeated addition

Area models

Multiply numerator only

Denominator stays the same

Multiplying a fraction by a fraction:

Multiply numerators

Multiply denominators

Simplify after

Use area models to explain why this works

Emphasize that multiplication can make numbers smaller when fractions are less than 1.

7. Real-World Fraction Applications

Model and solve problems involving:

Recipes

Measurement

Sharing or partitioning

Comparing amounts

Scaling quantities

Encourage drawing models and explaining reasoning clearly.
