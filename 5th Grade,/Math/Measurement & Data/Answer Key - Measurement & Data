Part A: Conversions (Customary)

72 inches = 6 feet

5 gallons = 20 quarts

7 yards = 21 feet

40 ounces = 2.5 pounds

Part B: Conversions (Metric)

3,000 milliliters = 3 liters

2.5 kilograms = 2,500 grams

9 meters = 900 centimeters

0.8 kilometers = 800 meters

Part C: Measuring & Comparing

4 cups = 2 pints

600 g = 0.6 kg

90 minutes > 1 hour (90 min > 60 min)

2.5 L > 2,300 mL (2.5 L = 2,500 mL)

Part D: Elapsed Time

8:15 AM → 3:05 PM

8:15 → 3:15 = 7 hours

Subtract 10 min → 6 hours 50 minutes

Answer: 6 hours 50 minutes

7:42 PM → 8:25 PM

7:42 → 8:00 = 18 minutes

8:00 → 8:25 = 25 minutes

Total = 43 minutes

Part E: Graphing & Data Interpretation

Most popular: Soccer (18 students)

Total students = 18 + 12 + 9 + 15 = 54 students

Soccer (18) – Baseball (9) = 9 more students

Part F: Measurement Word Problems

4.5 L = 4,500 mL
4,500 ÷ 750 = 6 full bottles

21 feet ÷ 3.5 feet = 6 sections

55 gallons ÷ 2.5 gallons/hour = 22 hours

Part G: Challenge Questions

Metric is easier because all conversions use powers of ten, so units shift by moving the decimal (cm→m→km). Customary units change unpredictably (12 in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, etc.).

1 kilogram ≠ 1,000 pounds.
1 kilogram = about 2.2 pounds.
A kilogram is a metric unit of mass; a pound is a customary unit.
A student is confusing “kilo = 1,000” with “1,000 pounds,” which is not related.
