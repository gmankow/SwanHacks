Part A: Line Plot Interpretation

The line plot shows the length of pencils (in inches) collected by students:
Lengths: 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7

How many pencils are 5 inches long?

How many total pencils were measured?

What is the difference between the shortest and longest pencil?

Part B: Bar Graph Reading

A bar graph shows the number of books read by students:

Alex: 7

Mia: 12

Jordan: 9

Sam: 6

Who read the most books?

How many more books did Mia read than Sam?

How many books were read altogether?

Part C: Creating a Table

Use the data below to create a 3-column table:
Pet counts at a shelter:

Dogs: 14

Cats: 9

Rabbits: 5

Birds: 3

Create a table with columns: Pet, Count, Total Legs.
(Calculate legs assuming: dogs/cats = 4 legs, rabbits = 4 legs, birds = 2 legs.)

Part D: Data Word Problems

A jar contains 2.5 liters of lemonade. If each cup holds 250 mL, how many cups can be filled?

A class survey shows the number of minutes students read each night:
20, 25, 30, 35, 25, 15, 20

What is the mode of the data?

A water tank contains 36 gallons of water. It is drained at a rate of 4 gallons per hour.
How long until the tank is empty?
