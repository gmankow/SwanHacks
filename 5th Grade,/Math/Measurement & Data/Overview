Objectives

Students will understand and apply:

Measuring length, weight/mass, volume, and temperature using standard units

Converting measurements within a system (metric and customary)

Reading and interpreting line plots, bar graphs, pictographs, and tables

Representing data using appropriate graphs and charts

Solving real-world problems involving measurement, time, and data displays

Key Content
1. Measurement Units and Tools

Introduce and review common measurement tools: rulers, meter sticks, scales, measuring cups, and thermometers.

Teach standard units:

Length: inches, feet, yards, miles; millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers

Mass/Weight: ounces, pounds, tons; grams, kilograms

Volume/Capacity: cups, pints, quarts, gallons; milliliters, liters

Temperature: Fahrenheit and Celsius

Model how to choose the correct tool and unit for different situations.

Emphasize accuracy and estimating before measuring.

2. Converting Measurements

Teach how to convert within the same system:

Customary: inches ↔ feet, feet ↔ yards, cups ↔ pints ↔ quarts ↔ gallons

Metric: millimeters ↔ centimeters ↔ meters ↔ kilometers

Show conversion using:

multiplication or division

conversion charts

number lines

Reinforce that metric conversions follow powers of ten, making them predictable and pattern-based.

3. Understanding and Representing Data

Introduce different types of data displays:

picture graphs

bar graphs

line plots

tables

frequency charts

Model how to collect data, organize it, and choose an appropriate graph.

Teach how to label axes, intervals, and units clearly.

Emphasize reading graphs carefully to understand totals, differences, and trends.

4. Interpreting Data

Teach students how to:

find maximums, minimums, and mode

compare categories or data points

calculate totals and differences directly from graphs

draw conclusions or make predictions based on displayed data

Use real-world scenarios to show the importance of understanding what data tells us.

5. Solving Measurement Word Problems

Model multi-step problems that involve:

converting units

using operations with measurement

reading a graph to solve a problem

measuring elapsed time

comparing quantities across categories

Emphasize showing work, using diagrams when helpful, and checking for reasonableness of answers.
