Homeschool Bot
A "Tech for Social Good" project for SwanHacks Hackathon

Problem:
Homeschooling parents face the immense challenge of acting as a teacher, curriculum designer, and administrator all at once. This leads to significant burnout and makes it difficult to consistently create engaging, high-quality, and personalized educational content for their children. Parents also may run into the issue of being unable to teach higher level topics to their children.

Our Solution:
The Homeschool Bot is a web app that serves as the "lesson planner" to help the parents, and the "tutor" to help the students. By automating the most time consuming tasks and providing on demand help, our project aims to improve the lives of homeschooling families, and spread high quality, personalized education to those who need it.
    
The bot can:
1. Help parents plan lessons for their children
2. Be used as a tutor to help teach children children when parents can't explain challenging concepts themselves
3. Help create hands-on activities for parents and children

Two Seperate Features to prompt engineer:
1. Create lesson plans to help parents (Material and Activites)
2. Tutor kids and help explain problems that they get wrong

Technology Used:
1. Python and Flask for backend
2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend
3. OpenAI API Key
