</head>
<body>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>Students will understand and apply:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with whole numbers</li>
    <li>Strategies for solving multi-digit operations efficiently and accurately</li>
    <li>Models and representations (arrays, area models, number lines, place-value strategies)</li>
    <li>The relationship between multiplication and division</li>
    <li>Order of operations for evaluating expressions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Content</h2>

  <h3>1. Addition and Subtraction Structure</h3>
  <p>Introduce and review how place value supports multi-digit addition and subtraction.</p>
  <p>Emphasize that digits must be aligned by place (ones under ones, tens under tens) to add or subtract correctly.</p>
  <p>Model how regrouping works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Carrying occurs when a place exceeds 9 in addition</li>
    <li>Borrowing occurs when the top digit is smaller in subtraction</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Demonstrate solving multi-digit equations step-by-step, using both standard algorithms and place-value strategies.</p>

  <h3>2. Multiplication Concepts and Models</h3>
  <p>Teach multiple ways to understand and represent multiplication:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Equal groups</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Area models</li>
    <li>Repeated addition</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Show how multi-digit multiplication builds from place value, with each shift representing ×10.</p>
  <p>Introduce standard algorithms after conceptual models so students understand why the steps work.</p>
  <p>Connect multiplication facts to patterns and strategies for fluency.</p>

  <h3>3. Division Concepts and Relationships</h3>
  <p>Explain division as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Making equal groups</li>
    <li>Repeated subtraction</li>
    <li>The inverse of multiplication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use models such as arrays, equal groups, and number lines to build understanding.</p>
  <p>Demonstrate partial quotients and long division for larger numbers.</p>
  <p>Highlight fact families to show the relationship between multiplication and division.</p>
  <p>Practice interpreting remainders in real-world contexts.</p>

  <h3>4. Order of Operations</h3>
  <p>Review how to evaluate expressions using a consistent order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Parentheses</li>
    <li>Multiplication and Division from left to right</li>
    <li>Addition and Subtraction from left to right</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Use examples to model simplification step-by-step.</p>
  <p>Explain that following this order ensures everyone gets the same result for the same expression.</p>
  <p>Apply order of operations to whole-number expressions without exponents.</p>

  <h3>5. Problem-Solving with All Four Operations</h3>
  <p>Teach students how to decide which operation a problem requires.</p>
  <p>Model using equations, bar models, or diagrams to represent the situation.</p>
  <p>Practice multi-step word problems that require combining operations.</p>
  <p>Emphasize explaining reasoning and checking answers using inverse operations.</p>
  <p>Reinforce that accurate problem-solving includes choosing the correct operation, showing work, and justifying the solution.</p>
